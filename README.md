# how to use
The repo contains `/home/$USER/` configs of my Linux setup. 
The directory structure mirros mine, paths should work as-is if cloned. 

# the `mpv` config:
`mpv` is a cross-platform media player, which you probably prefer over `VLC` just like me:

[Here](https://github.com/hopsayer/personal-linux-configs/tree/main/.config/mpv)'s my mpv config, mentioned in the article. 
 
It makes it more comfortable than by default:

* Player window stays open after playback finishes
* Loop open files infinitely
* Playback control panel (OSC) now hides later and has a fade-out animation.
* Service messages hide later than by default. 
* Inactive mouse cursor hides later. 
* Hardware decoding by default if available
