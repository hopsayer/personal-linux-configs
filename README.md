# how to use
The repo contains `/home/$USER/` configs of my Linux setup. 
The directory structure mirros mine, paths should work as-is if cloned. 

# the `mpv` config:
mpv is a cross-platform media player, which you probably prefer over VLC just like me:

[Here](https://github.com/hopsayer/personal-linux-configs/tree/main/.config/mpv)'s my mpv config, mentioned in the article. 

It makes it more comfortable than by default:

* Better keybinds for seeking and playback speed
* Instant pause on window focus loss
* Hardware acceleration
* Sharper video scaling
* Compact OSD
* Mouse wheel controls
* Useful scripts and extensions
